"""
This module shows a minimal wrapper for handling LiveKit interactions.
For local submission we simulate inbound calls by POSTing to /livekit_webhook.
If you want to integrate with LiveKit Cloud, follow their quickstart and configure webhooks.
Refs: LiveKit Agents quickstart + telephony guides.
"""
from livekit import Room, RoomServiceClient  # example import; actual API usage depends on SDK version
# For the purposes of this project we do not need to implement full LiveKit audio handling.
# If you decide to integrate, use the LiveKit agent starter and telephony docs (see citations).
# Example: dispatch agent to dial a number or receive SIP call. See LiveKit telephony docs.
